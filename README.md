# Welcome to My GitHub!

## 👋 About Me

A recent graduate of BSc Computer Science, from the University of Nottingham, I am pleased you have found my GitHub and hope you enjoy viewing some of the projects I have had the pleasure of working on.

Having had exposure to a wide variety of different concepts and areas in the world of computer science, as I move further into my career I have found a real passion for data analytics and leveraging data to provide valuable and previously inaccessible insights into business and help drive a more data-focused decision-making culture.

## 💻 Tech Interests

Having always had an interest in technology I am fascinated in the ever changing world. From consumer tech such as the newest phone or tablet to large scale technology system news, such as the rise of AI in the form of LLMs - (see my attempt at creating a much smaller scale NLP/NLG chat bot in my repos).

I am a big welcomer of the use of AI tools such as ChatGPT, and believe that this technology will not replace us (especially in the software and data field, as often feared), but when used correctly enable us to reach even greater heights.
